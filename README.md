Coffee Sales Dashboard â€“ Data-Driven Insights for Smarter Sales Strategies

This Excel-powered dashboard provides a comprehensive view of coffee sales by integrating dynamic filters and interactive visualizations. Designed for efficient business tracking, it helps uncover key sales patterns and customer preferences.

Project Highlights:
  - Dynamic Order Tracking â€“ Users can filter by order date, sales period (via slider), and roast type (dark, light, medium) to track trends over time.

  - Customer Insights â€“ Identified top 5 customers based on purchase volume, helping businesses target loyal buyers and personalize marketing efforts.

  - Sales Performance by Country â€“ Analyzed regional trends, allowing businesses to identify high-performing markets and growth opportunities.

  - Loyalty Card Analysis â€“ Evaluated the impact of loyalty programs on customer retention and repeat purchases.

  - Time-Based Sales Trends â€“ Visualized total sales over time, helping optimize inventory and marketing efforts based on peak sales periods.

What makes this project stand out? I combined advanced Excel techniques like interactive slicers, data validation, and dynamic charts to create a user-friendly yet powerful sales tracking tool. This dashboard enables businesses to make data-backed decisions, improve customer retention, and boost profitability. ðŸš€
